A hole was made to a pen cap and was hanged from the bob of a pendulum. The cap was filled with ink which dripped from the hole. Below it paper was placed on a movable platform. Setting the pendulum into motion, the platform below was moved with uniform velocity. Sinusoidal waves were traced on the paper.


The simple experiment demonstrates a mathematical function being traced out by a physical object.  High school students can relate more easily to the trigonometric functions by witnessing such an experiment.
