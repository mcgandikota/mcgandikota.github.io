# LaTeX with MathJax

A famous equation in physics: $E = mc^2\,.$  

And another set of famous equations in display math mode:

$$
\begin{align*}
  \nabla\cdot\mathbf{E} &= \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}\\
  \nabla\cdot\mathbf{B} &= 0\\
  \nabla\times\mathbf{E} &= -\frac{\partial\mathbf{B}}{\partial{t}}\\
  \nabla\times\mathbf{B} &= \mu_0\mathbf{J} + \epsilon_0\mu_0\frac{\partial\mathbf{E}}{\partial{t}}
\end{align*}
