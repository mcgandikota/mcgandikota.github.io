<p><em>Advisor</em>: <a href="https://inspirehep.net/authors/993502">Prof. Shashikant Phatak</a>, Institute of Physics, Bhubaneswar</p>
<p><em>Abstract</em>: A very brief and unhelpful discussion on Classical mechanics is given. The next section reports basic studies on chaos in logistic maps.</p>

<h3 id="rattlebacks">Rattlebacks</h3>
<p><em>Advisor</em>: <a href="http://www.physics.iisc.ernet.in/~sriram/">Prof. Sriram Ramaswamy</a>, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore</p>
<p><em>Abstract</em>: We begin by examining the dynamics of a single rattleback. Then the paper by Tsai et.al (2005) is described briefly based upon which the equations of the system for a mixture of chiral objects and their mirror objects were worked out (section(3)). The theme of the report is to observe how the chirality of the object induces a spin preference to the object. Be it a rattleback which has a complex shape or a simple wire bent in two places to make it chiral.</p>

<p><em>Advisor</em>: <a href="https://www.icts.res.in/people/abhishek-dhar">Prof. Abhishek Dhar</a>, International Centre for Theoretical Sciences, Bangalore</p>
<p><em>Abstract</em>: Unbiased, biased and persistent random walks are discussed. The results of the simulations of their basic moments are shown. The models and thermodynamics that is relevant to [2] which is a work related to the behaviour of semi- flexible polymers as predicted by the WLC model is explained in a section. Basic theory and few simulations pertaining to the behaviour of E.Coli forms the last section.</p>

<h3 id="martensitic-phase-transition-of-bacteriophage-t4s-tail-sheath">Martensitic phase transition of bacteriophage T4’s tail sheath</h3>
<p><em>Advisor</em> : <a href="https://www.ashoka.edu.in/welcome/faculty#!/somendra-m-bhattacharjee-1528">Prof. Somendra Bhattacharjee</a>, Ashoka University, Sonepat, Haryana</p>
<p><em>Abstract</em>: The martensitic phase transition of the tail-sheath of the virus - bacteriophage T4 is studied by mapping the problem to a 2 state spin system. The dynamics of the interface and the equilibrium behaviour of this model is studied using Monte Carlo simulations. The phase diagram of the virus model at <span class="math inline">\(T = 0\)</span> is calculated. The results of interface simulations predicts a uniform velocity regime for the movement of the interface. The velocity-temperature profile of interface shows a maximum at <span class="math inline">\(T ≈ 0.6 Tc\)</span> .</p>
<p>This project continued on to be my MSc thesis project. We plan to publish our findings at some point. Abstract enclosed is the one used for my final MSc thesis report.</p>
