<h3 id="classical-mechanics-and-chaos">Classical mechanics and chaos</h3>
<p><em>Advisor</em>: Prof. Shashikant Phatak, Institute of Physics, Bhubaneswar</p>
<p><em>Abstract</em>: A very brief and unhelpful discussion on Classical mechanics is given. The next section reports basic studies on chaos in logistic maps.</p>

<h3 id="rattlebacks">Rattlebacks</h3>
<p><em>Advisor</em>: Prof. Sriram Ramaswamy, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore</p>
<p><em>Abstract</em>: We begin by examining the dynamics of a single rattleback. Then the paper by Tsai et.al (2005) is described briefly based upon which the equations of the system for a mixture of chiral objects and their mirror objects were worked out (section(3)). The theme of the report is to observe how the chirality of the object induces a spin preference to the object. Be it a rattleback which has a complex shape or a simple wire bent in two places to make it chiral.</p>

<h3 id="persistent-random-walk">Persistent random walk</h3>
<p><em>Advisor</em>: Prof. Abhishek Dhar, International Centre for Theoretical Sciences, Bangalore</p>
<p><em>Abstract</em>: Unbiased, biased and persistent random walks are discussed. The results of the simulations of their basic moments are shown. The models and thermodynamics that is relevant to [2] which is a work related to the behaviour of semi- flexible polymers as predicted by the WLC model is explained in a section. Basic theory and few simulations pertaining to the behaviour of E.Coli forms the last section.</p>
