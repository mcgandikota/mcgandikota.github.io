<p>Towards explaining experimental observations, I use a mix of numerical simulations/solvers and analytical models arguments to corroborate the same. While the former is indispensible when enquiring into the more involved behaviours of the model, the latter proves usful in studying the simplest possible cases of the model. Such an analytic study may provide simple mechanisms at work which could possibly be the leading contribution to the experimental observations. A match between the numerics and analytics for the simplest case which can be solved by the latter provides confidence in the implementation of numerical solvers.</p>

<li>Compression of a single animal cell and a fibrin network with embedded beads leads to a non-linear elastic response. This non-linearity is the <i>compression stiffening</i> phenomenon where the stress-strain response exceeds linear response of a simple Hookean spring. We constructed discrete two dimensional network models to explain the response of these systems. The findings of this line of effort is reported in this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03725">paper</a>.<br><br> Energy minimization is achieved for the loop/network models via numerical solvers. Analytical corroboration is provided by investigating a rhombus/elliptical loop and writing exact energy expressions for the affine response of the fully occupied lattice network.</li>

<li>The folds in the cerebellum are different from the folds in the cerebrum in two ways. Unlike the cerebrum, the cerebellum has an approximate cylindrical geometry which allows for two dimensional modeling. Secondly, the folds in the cerebellum are scale-invariant i.e. even the small cerebellums like that of mice have folds just like the bigger cerebellums like that of pigs do. In a developing cerebellum, the cortex is seen to be the thickest at the troughs and thinnest at the crests. Recently the <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.8.041053">’buckling without bending</a> or <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/45019">‘multi-phase’</a> model was introduced to explain these observations. In an extension of the work we studied the non-linearities of this model in terms of having non-linear radial glial springs, steric effects due to confinement and the problem of hierarchy. We could reproduce certain features of cerebellar growth at later stages such as cusped troughs, squashed crests and hierarchial folding. <br><br> An oscillator called the `Asymmetric dampening oscillator’ was studied which involves a <span class="math inline">\(E = mc^2\,.\)</span> <span class="math display">\[
