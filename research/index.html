<p>My current research is in a class of nonequilibrium systems termed as
<em>active matter</em>. The principal motivation of the field came from
the need to understand biological systems which are inherently out of
equilibrium. Systems that are out of equilibrium display fascinating
behaviour such as flocking in birds and clustering of bacteria. Such
steady states are forbidden in equilibrium matter since they would
disobey the second law of thermodynamics. Synthetically, microscopic
active colloids (Janus particles) can be constructed which are
<em>self-propelled</em> due to chemical reactions they undergo with the
medium around it. The broad question to be answered is - how can complex
emergent phenomenon arise from simple self-propulsion at the particle
level, be it birds, bacteria or Janus particles. <a

is different</a>, said P.W. Anderson, we probe this phenomenon in the
specific case of active matter. Using molecular dynamics simulations, I
study <em>dry</em> active matter i.e. without explicit accounting of
hydrodynamics. If you are interested, do look at my <a
href="../papers">publications</a> and references within.</p>
<p><br> In my doctoral studies, towards explaining experimental
observations, I used a mix of numerical simulations/solvers and
analytical models arguments to corroborate the same. While the former is
indispensible when enquiring into the more realistic versions of the
model, the latter proves useful in studying the simplest version of the
model. Such an analytical study may provide simple mechanisms at work
which could possibly be the leading contribution to the experimental
observations. A match between the numerics and analytics for the
simplest case which can be solved by the latter provides confidence in
the implementation of numerical solvers.</p>

Compression stiffening in semiflexible networks
</h3>
Compression of a single animal cell and a fibrin network with embedded
beads leads to a non-linear elastic response. This non-linearity is the
<i>compression stiffening</i> phenomenon where the stress-strain
response exceeds linear response of a simple Hookean spring. We
constructed discrete two dimensional network models to explain the
response of these systems. Area conserving inclusions embedded in a
semiflexible network are seen to excite bending modes in the network
which bring about compression stiffening. <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03725.pdf">Paper here</a>.<br><br>
Energy minimization is achieved for the loop/network models via
numerical solvers. Analytical corroboration is provided by investigating
a rhombus/elliptical loop and writing exact energy expressions for the
affine response of the fully occupied lattice network.</li>

<p>Folding mechanism in cerebellum</p>
</h3>
<p>The folds in the cerebellum are different from the folds in the
cerebrum in two ways. Unlike the cerebrum, the cerebellum has an
approximate cylindrical geometry which allows for two dimensional
modeling. Secondly, the folds in the cerebellum are scale-invariant
i.e. even the small cerebellums of mice have folds just like the bigger
cerebellums of pigs. In a developing cerebellum, the cortex is seen to
be the thickest at the troughs and thinnest at the crests. Purely
elastic models cannot explain such an observation in the developing
cerebellum. Recently the <a
href="https://journals.aps.org/prx/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevX.8.041053">’buckling
without bending</a> model was introduced to explain the same. In an <a
href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.08576.pdf">extension of the work</a> we
studied the non-linearities of this model in terms of having non-linear
radial glial springs, steric effects due to confinement and the problem
of hierarchy. We could reproduce certain features of cerebellar growth
at later stages such as cusped troughs, squashed crests and hierarchical
folding. <br><br> The coupling between the Euler-Lagrange equations of
the two degrees of freedom in the problem introduces a robust quadratic
non-linearity of the form <span
class="math inline">\(\left(\frac{dx}{d\theta}\right)^2\)</span>. To
isolate the effect of such a non-linearity in generating cusped sharp
troughs, we studied an unphysical oscillator called the
`assisting-dampening oscillator’ which is a simple harmonic oscillator
with a forcing term of <span
class="math inline">\(\left(\frac{dx}{d\theta}\right)^2\)</span>. We see
sharp cusps even in this simple oscillator.</p></li>

<p>Convexity induced rigidity transitions in spring networks</p>
</h3>
<p>With sufficient number of constraints/springs in a spring network, we
can rigidify the network. By increasing the number of such constraints,
we can remove the degrees of freedom of the network in its configuration
space. When all the degrees of freedom are removed, the network is said
to be rigid. <br><br> In other words, a floppy mode is a non-trivial
deformation that doesn’t cost the network any energy. When a network has
no floppy modes, it is said to be rigid. Using the rank-nullity theorem
from linear algebra, we can study the compatibility/rigidity matrix of
the network which encodes the geometry of the network. We can then find
the presence/absence of floppy modes and thus know whether the network
is floppy/rigid. <br><br> Even with insufficient springs, we can bring
rigidity to the network by imposing an external strain. For example, a
1D chain of springs is floppy. But, upon uniaxial tension, it
rigidifies. This is called a strain induced rigidity transition. We are
currently studying spring networks under isotropic expansion strain and
investigating the role convexity has in inducing a rigidity
transition.</p></li>
<li><h3>
<p>Null model for mouse neural network</p>
</h3>
<p>Using the principles of statistical mechanics, we can produce <a
href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0405566.pdf">maximally unbiased
ensemble of networks</a> which obey the constraints imposed by the real
world networks. Such models prove useful in constructing null models
with which the real world networks can be compared against. With the
data of Allen brain atlas for mice, we use the number of neighbors for
nodes as the constraints of the real world network and produce a
maximally unbiased ensemble of networks which obey these constraints on
an average. This formalism is exactly equivalent to the canonical
ensemble formalism of statistical mechanics and is analytically
tractable to an extent.</p></li>
