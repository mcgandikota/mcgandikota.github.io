<p>Towards explaining experimental observations, I use a mix of numerical simulations/solvers and analytical models arguments to corroborate the same. While the former is indispensible when enquiring into the more involved behaviours of the model, the latter proves usful in studying the simplest possible cases of the model. Such an analytic study may provide simple mechanisms at work which could possibly be the leading contribution to the experimental observations. Also A match of the numerics and analytical results for the simplest case provides confidence in the implementation of numerical solvers.</p>

<li>Compression of a single animal cell and a fiber network with embedded beads leads to a non-linear elastic response. This non-linearity is the <i>compression stiffening</i> phenomenon where the stress-strain response exceeds linear response of a simple Hookean spring. We constructed discrete two dimensional network models to explain the response of these systems. The findings of this line of effort is reported in this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03725">paper</a>.</li>

<p>Energy minimization is achieved for the loop/network models via numerical solvers. Analytical corroboration is provided by investigating a rhombus/elliptical loop and writing exact energy expressions for the affine response of the fully occupied lattice network.</p>
